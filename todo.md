## General

* Need to implement sql db for storage (maybe sqlalchemy?)

## Chi2

* How to construct contours with other constraints:
    * maybe this need to be done in PA/Constraints when we make the call to
      collect the constraints from the dict
    * also need something to collect appropriate args for hte LFs

## FeynHiggs

* find out why PrecObs\_\* don't get filled (are these SLHA only: if so how do
  you get bsgamma etc.) -> these are macros to the SLHADATA array object members
