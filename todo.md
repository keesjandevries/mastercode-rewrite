## General

* start writing a makefile
* abstract out our nice "run\_point" app into :
    - [slha\_generator, slha\_modifiers, slha\_additions]
* slha class just used as intermediary: want slha->dict and dict->sql db

## SLHA

* Bug fix cause of MX scale from softsusy
* Bug fix: capitalizing everything: maybe implement in python instead (mH and
  MH)

## FeynHiggs

* find out why PrecObs\_\* don't get filled (are these SLHA only: if so how do you get bsgamma etc.)

## bphysics and POPE

* write c-fortran interface for these.
* place POPE in repo: ask frederic / thomas / sven about this
* decide on what to do with bphysics
