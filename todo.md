# General

* start writing a makefile
* abstract out our nice "testPoint" app into :
    - [slha_generator, slha_modifiers, slha_additions]
* slha class just used as intermediary: want slha->dict and dict->sql db

# SLHA

* Bug fix cause of MX scale from softsusy
* Bug fix: capitalizing everything: maybe implement in python instead

# FeynHiggs

* find out why PrecObs_* don't get filled (are these SLHA only: if so how do you get bsgamma etc.)
