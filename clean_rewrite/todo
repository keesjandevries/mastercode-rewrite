# BUGS

* os.waitpid() hanging as child process not exiting: expect no control return from c-interface
* FH not correctly reading pipe: eols? (check it can be read in python, then c-interface, then base fortran)

# General

* start writing a makefile

# SLHA

* decide on base representation and move away from the abomination that is Rtypes.h: less ROOT dependency the better!
