# General

* start writing a makefile

# SLHA

* decide on base representation and move away from the abomination that is Rtypes.h: less ROOT dependency the better!
* could use --std=c++11 so we can use int8_t etc.

# FeynHiggs

* find out why PrecObs_* don't get filled (are these SLHA only: if so how do you get bsgamma etc.)
