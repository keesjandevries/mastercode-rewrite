# General

* start writing a makefile

# SLHA

* decide on base representation and move away from the abomination that is Rtypes.h: less ROOT dependency the better!
* could use --std=c++11 so we can use int8_t etc.

# FeynHiggs

* needs to take a new SLHA file object (in run_feynhiggs) and append the relevant lines to it (ideally we do this in python , but not sure how we get the information out)
